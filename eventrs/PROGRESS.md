  - `emit_batch_concurrent()` - Parallel batch processing
  - `emit_stream()` - Lazy stream processing
  - `emit_stream_concurrent()` - Concurrent stream with worker pools
  - `emit_and_forget()` - Fire-and-forget operations
  - `emit_bulk_and_forget()` - Bulk fire-and-forget

- **2.3 Priority Management** ✅
  - PriorityValue and Priority::Custom() for fine-grained control
  - HandlerGroup for organizing handlers by priority
  - PriorityChain for managing multiple priority groups

## 🛠️ Core Architecture

### Event System Components
```rust
// Type-safe events with derive macro
#[derive(Event, Clone, Debug)]
struct UserLoggedIn { user_id: u64 }

// Multiple event bus types
EventBus           // Synchronous, single-threaded
AsyncEventBus      // Asynchronous with tokio
ThreadSafeEventBus // Thread-safe, concurrent
```

### Priority System
```rust
// Built-in priority levels
Priority::Critical  // 1000
Priority::High      // 750  
Priority::Normal    // 500 (default)
Priority::Low       // 250

// Custom priority values
Priority::Custom(PriorityValue::new(600))

// Handler organization
HandlerGroup::with_name(Priority::High, "validation")
PriorityChain::new() // Manages multiple groups
```

### Processing Patterns
```rust
// Batch processing
bus.emit_batch(events)?;
bus.emit_batch_concurrent(events)?;

// Stream processing  
bus.emit_stream(event_stream)?;
bus.emit_stream_concurrent(stream, workers)?;

// Fire-and-forget
bus.emit_and_forget(event)?;
bus.emit_bulk_and_forget(events)?;
```
